- Documentation is complete

- slow compilation

- Frobenius norm and matrix-vector products are different in row and column major cases
    The correct ones are the output by row (The RowMajor and ColumnMajor matrices in the test executable are 
    very slightly different, so the different output is to be expected. Sorry if that wasn't clear)

- use for loops to repeat the tests many times!

- you don't need to define specializations of the operator* for every template type, you can define one taking into account the different possibilities
